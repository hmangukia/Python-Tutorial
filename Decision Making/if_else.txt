Python Conditions and If statements:-

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.


Elif:-

The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".


Else:-

The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.


Short Hand If:-

If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.


Short Hand If ... Else:-

If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line.


Nested If:-

You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
