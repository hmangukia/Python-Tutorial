Nested Loops In Python:

It is the process of placing one loop in another loop that means cascading the
loops one inside another.

In python, there is no concept of '{}' to identify block. It distinguishes
different blocks with indentation. So, in nesting indentation is very important,
as it will identify inner loop from outer loop.
